### Explanation

This is a cog that was converted from another bot, Discordant. Original design credit goes to the creator liljohny. Special thanks to Aikaterna for requesting the conversion.

This cog will attempt to translate romaji, hiragana, kanji, and katakana into English and output the top most likely translations. It will also try to translate an English input to Japanese. To try out the command type:

`!jisho word`
