### Introduction

This  cog is a conversion from a mee6 plugin. All credit goes to the original creator. It functions exactly the same and will retrieve information on both anime and manga requests.

Example:

![example](https://i.gyazo.com/f41621facd7c30b4097fcabf0ac21ac9.gif)

The command to search is  
`!anime animename`  
      Or for manga:  
`!manga manganame`  

Once it completes the search, it will give you a list of titles that match. Select the one that you wish to view information about by typing in the corresponding number.
