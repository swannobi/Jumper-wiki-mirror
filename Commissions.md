# Overview

I am willing to do a lot of stuff for free, but It might take a while for me to add what you want due to how many of my own projects / real life commitments. However, with commission work it takes priority over all general projects that I'm working on. Anything that you request for me to create is subject to release on my github. Your donation to begin work on something does not grant exclusive rights to that feature or cog, but rather funding it's creation. If you want a cog to be unique to you, and only you please discuss this with me before development.

# Things I will not do:

* I will not create anything malicious for you  
* I have no interest in changing another cog creator's work. Contact them if you want something altered.  
* Work on something that alter's red's core files  


# What I will do
* Add a feature to one of my existing cogs   
_Needs to match the spirit of the cog's intent_

* Create a new cog
  
* Conversions from other bots   
_Requires you to notify the original creator for permission_*  

### How this works:
If you commission me to work on a project, and I agree that I will be able to complete it I will request 40% of the total cost up front. For a project priced at 20 dollars, I will ask for 8 dollars. Once I have the project complete and you are satisfied I will request for the remaining payment

### Process

**Step 1**

The first step in this process is for you to give me an outline of what you want. For a single feature, I need to know your desired input and output.

For a complete cog creation I will need a list of the commands you want, along with the input and output of each command.

**Step 2**

If I accept the proposal(based on other commissions or real life issues) I will give you my cost for completion. 
At this time I will need 40% of the cost to begin work on the cog.

**Step 3**

I will begin development right away once I accept payment. You will receive a status update each day on the progress. I will invite you to several test sessions throughout this step to ensure my design is your intent.

**Step 4**  

Once you and I feel like the cog has met the requirements I will ask for the remaining 60% of the payment.  
Once payment is received I will release the cog to your custody

### Service Warranty

If something in red bot breaks your cog, because of an update, I will apply fixes to your cog. This does not constitute adding features.


### Timeline

Depending on the size and scope of your commission it will require a lot of time. Be patient, I'll be working as fast as I can.
